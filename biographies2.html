      <p> Another notable woman in the Sultanate of women was Nurbanu (b.?- 1583). Born Cecila Venier Baffo and the illegimate daughter of two ventian nobles Nurbanu was abducted and brought to Istanbul as a young girl.  There she  became the favorite of Hurrems second son, Sezhade Selim and was given the name 'Nurbanu' meaning 'princess of light'. Nurbanu became so important to Selim that when he was sent to learn to govern in the provinces Nurbanu went with him. Like Hurrem before her Nurbanu eventually became Selim's legal wife and granted the title of 'Haskei Sultan'. During their years together Selim and Nurbanu had four daughters and one son, the future Murad the Third. Unfortunately Sultan Selim was a terrible drinker and one day he slipped and hit his head in the bathhouse after he had been drinking. Clever and strong Nurbanu saw the path to placing her son on the throne. She ordered for Selim's body to be placed in the ice house until her son Murad arrived in Istanbul. After Murad arrived Nurbanu instructed her son to follow through with his duty to have his half brothers killed in order to ensure his acession to the throne. After her son was securely on the throne Nurbanu became the first to take the title 'valide sultan'or 'queen mother'. This means that Nurbanu was also the first woman to hold the titles of both 'haskei sultan' and 'valide sultan'. As Valide Sultan Nurbanu exercised considerable power with her influence over her son. However, Nurbanu was partial to the venetian cause because of her roots and she seems to have been deeply resented for this. In fact some say that Nurbanu was poisons because of this at the age of about 57. Breaking with tradition her son Murad would not only attend her funeral (again despite the tradition of Sultans not attending the funerals of women), he would walk behind his mothers casket opening crying and showing his reference for her. Therefore another chapter in the Sultanate of Women came to an end.
