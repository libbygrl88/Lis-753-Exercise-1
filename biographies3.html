    <h2 class="section-title"> "Kosem Sultan"</h2>
      <p> Considered by some to the most powerful figure in the Sultanate of Women was Kosem Sultan (b.?-1651).  Believed to be the daughter of a orthodox priest from the Greek island of Tinos named Anastastia she was  captured and brought to Istanbul at the age of around 15. Anastastia quickly became a favorite of Sultan Ahmed l and he favored her so much that he gave her the name Kosem meaning ''leader of the herd.''. Throughout their years together Kosem was a great advisor to Sultan Ahmed. The couple also had 12 known children including the future sultans Murad iv and Ibrahim l. Ahmed and Kosems relationship continued to grew and he legally married although there doesn't appear to have been a formal ceremony. Tragically Sultan Ahmed dies young at the age of 28. Kosem and her children were then banished to the palace of tears as her oldest Murad was to young to make a claim for the throne. Instead Kosem bid her time as Ahmed's brother Mustafa and oldest son Osman battled for the throne. Mustafa initially won but he had mental health problems and its soon became clear that he was unfit to rule and Osman eventually took the throne. However Osman came into conflict with his personal army the janassaires and he was eventually assainated. By this time Murad was old enough to take the throne and Kosem served well as his regent. Inevitablly though Murad grew older and started asserting his own authority although his mother remained one of his most trusted advisors. However like his father Sultan Murad would die young at the age of 28. After left the Ottoman throne to the only surviving Ottoman male Kosem's son, Ibrahim. However, Ibrahim was traumized from having witnessed his brother Murad murder their other brothers. This meant that Ibrahim was too mentally unstable to rule and it was decided that Kosem would act as regent for a second time. Sadly, Ibrahims mental state continued to decline and he was eventually assainated. This meant that the throne passed to Ibrahim's son, Memhed. Like Kosem's son Murad little Mehmed was too young to rule and a battle over the regency ensued between Kosem and Mehmeds mother, Turhan, with Kosem emerging as victor over the inexperienced Turhan. Eventually Kosem decided she wanted to replace Mehmed with another grandson whose mother may more easily bend to her will. Kosem even ploted to have Mehmed and Turhan killed but the plan was brought to Turhans attention. Before Kosem could strike Turhan order those loyal to her to strangle Kosem in her chambers ending one of the largest chapters in the Sultanate of Women. </p>

    <h2 class="section-title"> "Turhan Sultan"</h2>
      <p> The last player in the sultante of women was Hatice Turhan Sultan (1627-1683).Like Hurren before her it is believed that Turhan Sultan was of Russian Ukraian origin and was abuducted from her homeland and brought to the Ottoman royal harem. It is believed that when Turhan was presented to Kosem Sultan as a gift she decided to groom the girl to seduce her son Ibrahim and secure the Ottoman dynasty. Kosem plans worked and  Turhan would bare Ibrahim his son and heir Memhed IV (much to the relief of the empire). Although Turhan also bore more children to the sultan the sultanas Beyhan, Gevherhan, and Atike the relationship between Turhan and Ibrahim was poor. Ibrahim wanted to pass over his son Mehmed and make the unrelated son of a servant his heir. One day in the gardens Turhan and Ibrahim argued about it and to spite Turhan Ibrahim
       threw Mehmed at the pool causeing him injury. This seems to be something that Turhan never forgave Ibrahim for and she would wait until her time to act. When Ibrahim was eventually overthrown and executed the throne passed  to Turhan's  son Mehmed, who was still a young child. At this time Turhan should have taken the position of Valide Sultan and regent to her son however the new sultans granmother, Kosem Sultan, wouldn't go peacefully into retirement. A bitter feud to establish influence on the child sultan ensued with Kosem winning the rights of the regency. However Kosem clearly feared Turhan and even ploted to have her killed. Turhan intercepted the plan and had Kosem executed instead. Finally Turhan achieved her goal of becoming Valide Sultan and regent. Turhan fullfilled this role well however as her son grew older he inevitablly assumed more power and authority. Turhan was wise even to know when it was time to step aside but she would remain an advisor to her son until her death in 1683.
