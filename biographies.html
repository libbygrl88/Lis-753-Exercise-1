    <h2 id="section-title">" Hurrem Sultan"</h2>
      <p> The first women recognized as being part of the sultanate of women was Hurren Sultan (b.?-1558). Widely believed to be from the Ukraine Hurrem Sultans was originally known as Alexandra. After she became a favorite of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent he gave her the name Hurrem which means ''the cheerful one''. Hurrems influence over Suleiman grew and he broke many conventions for her. First was Hurrem baring Suleiman four sons when the custom was only allowing a concubine to bare one son to the sultan. Then Suleiman made the shocking decision to marry Hurrem and created the title 'Haseki Sultan'or 'chief consort'for her. During their years together Suleiman and Hurrem  would have a total of five children Sezhade Memhed, Mirimah Sultan, Sezhade Selim, Sezhade Bayezid, and Sezhade Chigingar. Throughout their years together Hurrem and Suleiman would exchange letters when he would go away for long periods of time on campaign. This bond never wavered and Hurrem remained a vital confidant and advisor to her husband until she passed away from illness at the age of 53, . Suleiman would mourned his empress for eight years until he joined her in death. Hurrem had proven how far a simple concubine could go and set a precedent for the rest of the sultanate of women  </p>
    <h2 id="section-title"> "Mirimah Sultan"</h2>
      <p> Part of Hurrem Sultans legacy is seen in her daughter Mirimah (1522-1575), whose name means ''sun and moon''. Considered a power figure in the Sulanate of Women in her own right. Regarded as THE most powerful and influential of Ottoman princesses Mirimah carved a role for herself first as an advisor to her father, Suleiman the Magnificent, but also played a role in supporting her brother Sultan Selim ii. Following in the traditions of other Ottoman princesses Mirimah was married for the ambitions of the family to the grand vizier, Rustem Pasha. Although theirs appears to primarily be a marriage based on politics Mirimah and Rustem did come together to produce their three childre Ayse Humasah Sultan, Sultanzade Mehmed, and Sultanzade Murad Bey.
    <h2 id="section-title">"Nurbanu Sultan"</h2>
      <p> Another notable woman in the Sultanate of women was Nurbanu. Born Cecila Venier Baffo and the illegimate daughter of two ventian nobles Nurbanu was abducted and brought to Turkey as a young girl.  Nurbanu became the favorite of Hurrems second son, Sezhade Selim. Like Hurrem before her Nurbanu became Selim's legal wife and granted the title of Haskei Sultan. During their years together Selim and Nurbanu had four daughters and one son, the future Murad the Third.
    <h2 id="section-title"> "Kosem Sultan"</h2>
      <p> Considered by some to the most powerful figure in the Sultanate of Women was Kosem Sultan.  Believed to be the daughter of a orthodox priest from the Greek island of Tinos named Anastastia she was  captured and brought to Istanbul at the age of around 15 </p>
