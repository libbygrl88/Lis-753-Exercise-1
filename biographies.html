    <h2 class="section-title">" Hurrem Sultan"</h2>
      <p> The first women recognized as being part of the sultanate of women was Hurren Sultan (b.?-1558). Widely believed to be from the Ukraine Hurrem Sultans was originally known as Alexandra. After she became a favorite of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent he gave her the name Hurrem which means ''the cheerful one''. Hurrems influence over Suleiman grew and he broke many conventions for her. First was Hurrem baring Suleiman four sons when the custom was only allowing a concubine to bare one son to the sultan. Then Suleiman made the shocking decision to marry Hurrem and created the title 'Haseki Sultan'or 'chief consort'for her. During their years together Suleiman and Hurrem  would have a total of five children Sezhade Memhed, Mirimah Sultan, Sezhade Selim, Sezhade Bayezid, and Sezhade Chigingar. Throughout their years together Hurrem and Suleiman would exchange letters when he would go away for long periods of time on campaign. This bond never wavered and Hurrem remained a vital confidant and advisor to her husband until she passed away from illness at the age of 53. Suleiman would mourn his empress for eight years until he joined her in death, and he was buried beside her. Hurrem had proven how far a simple concubine could go and set a precedent for the rest of the sultanate of women  </p>

    <h2 class="section-title"> "Mihrimah Sultan"</h2>
      <p> Part of Hurrem Sultans legacy is seen in her daughter Mihrimah (1522-1575), whose name means ''sun and moon''. Considered a power figure in the Sulanate of Women in her own right, Mihrimah would set the bar for what Ottoman prinessess could strive for. Regarded as THE most powerful and influential of Ottoman princesses Mirimah carved a role for herself first as an advisor to her father, Suleiman the Magnificent, but also played a role in supporting her brother Sultan Selim ii. In fact Mihrimah seems to have acted as a puesdo Valide Sultan (Queen Mother) for her brother  Other Mihrimah was still an Ottoman princess and following in the traditions of other Ottoman princesses Mirimah was married off for the ambitions of the family to the grand vizier, Rustem Pasha. Although theirs appears to primarily be a marriage based on politics Mihrimah and Rustem did come together to produce their three childre Ayse Humasah Sultan, Sultanzade Mehmed, and Sultanzade Murad Bey. Like most high ranking Ottoman women Mihrimah dedicated much time and resources to charity, including the building of mosques. Mihrimah would serve as an important figure in the Sultanate of Women until her passing in 1578
