    <p>Since I can remember I have been a history buff. In particular I enjoy learning about strong women in history. In the past couple years I have learned about the Sultanate of Women. These women were wives,mothers, and in one case daughter and sister to the turkish sultans.These women helped rule the Ottoman Empire fromthe the early 16th century to the end of the 17th century</p>
    <p> For this project I decided to focus on the most important member of the Turkish Sulanate of Women. This include
         <ol>
           <li>Hurrem Sultan</li>
           <li>Mirimah Sultan</li>
           <li>Nurbanu Sultan</li>
           <li>Kosem Sultan</li>
           <li>Turhan Sultan</li>
         </ol>
     </p>
