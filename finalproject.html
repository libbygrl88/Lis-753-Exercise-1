    <h2 class="section-title"> A Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>Since I can remember I have been a history buff. In particular I enjoy learning about strong women in history. It is facinating to learn about how these women lived and worked in societies built and run by men. In the past couple years I have learned about the Sultanate of Women. These  facinating women were wives,mothers, and in one case daughters and sisters to the turkish sultans.This group of  women helped rule the Ottoman Empire from the the early 16th century to the end of the 17th century. Many of this women had brutal beginning coming to the Ottoman empires as slaves and sent to the sultans harem. What is interesting to note about these women is that as potential mothers of sultans they were expected to complete an education that would enable them to be worth advisors to their sons if their sons managed to fight their way to the throne. In fact it was a practice of the Ottoman empire that the sons of sultans would fight it out for the throne with the victor having his brothers killed to ensure his succession. Needless to say surviving in this world was not for the faint of heart and the women of the Sultanate of Women managed to rise above the constraints of their society and become major political players within the Ottoman Empire. </p>
    <p> For this project I decided to focus on some the most important members of the Turkish Sulanate of Women. This includes
         <ol class="list">
           <li>Hurrem Sultan</li>
           <li>Mirimah Sultan</li>
           <li>Nurbanu Sultan</li>
           <li>Kosem Sultan</li>
           <li>Turhan Sultan</li>
         </ol>
     </p>
    <h2 class="section-title"> Site Overview</h2>
     <p>  The main focus of this site is to provide some bioliographical information on this group who made up the Sultanate of Women. Each page contains a brief biography. However there will also be links to additional resources related to those women and even on the hompage I will add more resources for anyone who wants to go deeper into this historical subject.</p>
